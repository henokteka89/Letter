Hi Team,

We noticed that the stored procedure storedprocname caused a blockage in our prod environment for over 10 minutes yesterday. It's scanning a large volume of records in dbo.scheduleaudit due to a hardcoded date filter (dateentered > '3/1/2021'), where most records are recent and total over 100 million.

Could we:

Update the hardcoded date to narrow down the scan?
Run this procedure on the ATL node instead to ease prod load?
This should help manage performance better without waiting for data purging, as most records are from 2021 onwards.

Thanks for looking into this. Let me know your thoughts.
