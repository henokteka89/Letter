Subject: Urgent: Optimization Needed for High-Resource SQL Query

Dear Developers,

Our query store data reveals the SELECT statement with @BarcodeID (passed as NVARCHAR e.g., N'A10408') as a top resource consumer, due to a mismatch with the SQL table's VARCHAR(20) column. This type discrepancy leads to costly implicit conversions and performance issues.

Please adjust the application to pass BarcodeID as VARCHAR to align with the database and improve efficiency. Quick action on this will significantly reduce resource consumption and enhance overall performance.

Thank you for your cooperation.
